Please find the necessary code inside 'Retail_Guru.py', it has been used to complete two tasks:

Task A: Find the common monthly basket across customers. Monthly baskets are the one time large baskets that people tend to
buy at the start of the month (but not strictly in that period).

Task B: Find the items that can be sold in combo and the reason for these items to coexist in the combo.

The code also generates two csv files ('combo_items.csv' for Task B and 'monthly_basket.csv' for Task A) which contain 
the results i.e. frequent itemsets and their respective support.

Some quick points on Task B results:

1. All of the items in the combo are food items, not surprising as food is basic necessity for human survival.
2. Sugar and Salt are two common items which are used extensively in the whole world.
3. Other items in the list (such as ulundu, toor dhal) suggest that this combo of items might be from (or suitable for) 
   southern part of India (Tamil Nadu specifically) as ulundu is used to make Vada and toor dal to make Sambar 
   (toor dal is used on a daily basis in whole of India but ulundu (or urad dal) is not used so much in other parts of India).

In Task A, I have used time frame of first 7 days of a month to compute the monthly basket, I got this number from talking 
to friends and family members.

Note: Please change the path of data and csv files to write respectively, 'fim' package has been used to apply fpgrowth 
algorithm in the code, so please install it.
